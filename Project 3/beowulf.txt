PREFACE
The
present
work
is
a
modest
effort
to
reproduce
approximately
in
modern
measures
the
venerable
epic
Beowulf
Approximately
I
repeat
for
a
very
close
reproduction
of
AngloSaxon
verse
would
to
a
large
extent
be
prose
to
a
modern
ear
The
HeyneSocin
text
and
glossary
have
been
closely
followed
Occasionally
a
deviation
has
been
made
but
always
for
what
seemed
good
and
sufficient
reason
The
translator
does
not
aim
to
be
an
editor
Once
in
a
while
however
he
has
added
a
conjecture
of
his
own
to
the
emendations
quoted
from
the
criticisms
of
other
students
of
the
poem
This
work
is
addressed
to
two
classes
of
readers
From
both
of
these
alike
the
translator
begs
sympathy
and
cooperation
The
AngloSaxon
scholar
he
hopes
to
please
by
adhering
faithfully
to
the
original
The
student
of
English
literature
he
aims
to
interest
by
giving
him
in
modern
garb
the
most
ancient
epic
of
our
race
This
is
a
bold
and
venturesome
undertaking
and
yet
there
must
be
some
students
of
the
Teutonic
past
willing
to
follow
even
a
daring
guide
if
they
may
read
in
modern
phrases
of
the
sorrows
of
Hrothgar
of
the
prowess
of
Beowulf
and
of
the
feelings
that
stirred
the
hearts
of
our
forefathers
in
their
primeval
homes
In
order
to
please
the
larger
class
of
readers
a
regular
cadence
has
been
used
a
measure
which
while
retaining
the
essential
characteristics
of
the
original
permits
the
reader
to
see
ahead
of
him
in
reading
Perhaps
every
AngloSaxon
scholar
has
his
own
theory
as
to
how
Beowulf
should
be
translated
Some
have
given
us
prose
versions
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
great
poem
Is
it
any
reflection
on
our
honored
Kemble
and
Arnold
to
say
that
their
translations
fail
to
show
a
layman
that
Beowulf
is
justly
called
our
first
epic
Of
those
translators
who
have
used
verse
several
have
written
from
what
would
seem
a
mistaken
point
of
view
Is
it
proper
for
instance
that
the
grave
and
solemn
speeches
of
Beowulf
and
Hrothgar
be
put
in
ballad
measures
tripping
lightly
and
airily
along
Or
again
is
it
fitting
that
the
rough
martial
music
of
AngloSaxon
verse
be
interpreted
to
us
in
the
smooth
measures
of
modern
blank
verse
Do
we
hear
what
has
been
beautifully
called
the
clanging
tread
of
a
warrior
in
mail
viii
Of
all
English
translations
of
Beowulf
that
of
Professor
Garnett
alone
gives
any
adequate
idea
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
this
great
Teutonic
epic
The
measure
used
in
the
present
translation
is
believed
to
be
as
near
a
reproduction
of
the
original
as
modern
English
affords
The
cadences
closely
resemble
those
used
by
Browning
in
some
of
his
most
striking
poems
The
four
stresses
of
the
AngloSaxon
verse
are
retained
and
as
much
thesis
and
anacrusis
is
allowed
as
is
consistent
with
a
regular
cadence
Alliteration
has
been
used
to
a
large
extent
but
it
was
thought
that
modern
ears
would
hardly
tolerate
it
on
every
line
Endrhyme
has
been
used
occasionally
internal
rhyme
sporadically
Both
have
some
warrant
in
AngloSaxon
poetry
For
endrhyme
see
for
internal
rhyme
What
Gummere
calls
the
rimegiver
has
been
studiously
kept
viz
the
first
accented
syllable
in
the
second
halfverse
always
carries
the
alliteration
and
the
last
accented
syllable
alliterates
only
sporadically
Alternate
alliteration
is
occasionally
used
as
in
the
original
See
No
two
accented
syllables
have
been
brought
together
except
occasionally
after
a
csural
pause
See
and
Or
scientifically
speaking
Sieverss
C
type
has
been
avoided
as
not
consonant
with
the
plan
of
translation
Several
of
his
types
however
constantly
occur
eg

a
variant

x
B
and

Anacrusis
gives
further
variety
to
the
types
used
in
the
translation
The
parallelisms
of
the
original
have
been
faithfully
preserved
Eg
and
Lord
and
Wielder
of
Glory
and
and
and
Occasionally
some
loss
has
been
sustained
but
on
the
other
hand
a
gain
has
here
and
there
been
made
The
effort
has
been
made
to
give
a
decided
flavor
of
archaism
to
the
translation
All
words
not
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
poem
have
been
avoided
Again
though
many
archaic
words
have
been
used
there
are
none
it
is
believed
which
are
not
found
in
standard
modern
poetry
ix
With
these
preliminary
remarks
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
give
an
outline
of
the
story
of
the
poem
THE
STORY
Hrothgar
king
of
the
Danes
or
Scyldings
builds
a
great
meadhall
or
palace
in
which
he
hopes
to
feast
his
liegemen
and
to
give
them
presents
The
joy
of
king
and
retainers
is
however
of
short
duration
Grendel
the
monster
is
seized
with
hateful
jealousy
He
cannot
brook
the
sounds
of
joyance
that
reach
him
down
in
his
fendwelling
near
the
hall
Oft
and
anon
he
goes
to
the
joyous
building
bent
on
direful
mischief
Thane
after
thane
is
ruthlessly
carried
off
and
devoured
while
no
one
is
found
strong
enough
and
bold
enough
to
cope
with
the
monster
For
twelve
years
he
persecutes
Hrothgar
and
his
vassals
Over
sea
a
days
voyage
off
Beowulf
of
the
Geats
nephew
of
Higelac
king
of
the
Geats
hears
of
Grendels
doings
and
of
Hrothgars
misery
He
resolves
to
crush
the
fell
monster
and
relieve
the
aged
king
With
fourteen
chosen
companions
he
sets
sail
for
Daneland
Reaching
that
country
he
soon
persuades
Hrothgar
of
his
ability
to
help
him
The
hours
that
elapse
before
night
are
spent
in
beerdrinking
and
conversation
When
Hrothgars
bedtime
comes
he
leaves
the
hall
in
charge
of
Beowulf
telling
him
that
never
before
has
he
given
to
another
the
absolute
wardship
of
his
palace
All
retire
to
rest
Beowulf
as
it
were
sleeping
upon
his
arms
Grendel
comes
the
great
marchstepper
bearing
Gods
anger
He
seizes
and
kills
one
of
the
sleeping
warriors
Then
he
advances
towards
Beowulf
A
fierce
and
desperate
handtohand
struggle
ensues
No
arms
are
used
both
combatants
trusting
to
strength
and
handgrip
Beowulf
tears
Grendels
shoulder
from
its
socket
and
the
monster
retreats
to
his
den
howling
and
yelling
with
agony
and
fury
The
wound
is
fatal
The
next
morning
at
early
dawn
warriors
in
numbers
flock
to
the
hall
Heorot
to
hear
the
news
Joy
is
boundless
Glee
runs
high
Hrothgar
and
his
retainers
are
lavish
of
gratitude
and
of
gifts
Grendels
mother
however
comes
the
next
night
to
avenge
his
death
She
is
furious
and
raging
While
Beowulf
is
sleeping
in
a
room
somewhat
apart
x
from
the
quarters
of
the
other
warriors
she
seizes
one
of
Hrothgars
favorite
counsellors
and
carries
him
off
and
devours
him
Beowulf
is
called
Determined
to
leave
Heorot
entirely
purified
he
arms
himself
and
goes
down
to
look
for
the
female
monster
After
traveling
through
the
waters
many
hours
he
meets
her
near
the
seabottom
She
drags
him
to
her
den
There
he
sees
Grendel
lying
dead
After
a
desperate
and
almost
fatal
struggle
with
the
woman
he
slays
her
and
swims
upward
in
triumph
taking
with
him
Grendels
head
Joy
is
renewed
at
Heorot
Congratulations
crowd
upon
the
victor
Hrothgar
literally
pours
treasures
into
the
lap
of
Beowulf
and
it
is
agreed
among
the
vassals
of
the
king
that
Beowulf
will
be
their
next
liegelord
Beowulf
leaves
Daneland
Hrothgar
weeps
and
laments
at
his
departure
When
the
hero
arrives
in
his
own
land
Higelac
treats
him
as
a
distinguished
guest
He
is
the
hero
of
the
hour
Beowulf
subsequently
becomes
king
of
his
own
people
the
Geats
After
he
has
been
ruling
for
fifty
years
his
own
neighborhood
is
wofully
harried
by
a
firespewing
dragon
Beowulf
determines
to
kill
him
In
the
ensuing
struggle
both
Beowulf
and
the
dragon
are
slain
The
grief
of
the
Geats
is
inexpressible
They
determine
however
to
leave
nothing
undone
to
honor
the
memory
of
their
lord
A
great
funeralpyre
is
built
and
his
body
is
burnt
Then
a
memorialbarrow
is
made
visible
from
a
great
distance
that
sailors
afar
may
be
constantly
reminded
of
the
prowess
of
the
national
hero
of
Geatland
The
poem
closes
with
a
glowing
tribute
to
his
bravery
his
gentleness
his
goodness
of
heart
and
his
generosity
It
is
the
devout
desire
of
this
translator
to
hasten
the
day
when
the
story
of
Beowulf
shall
be
as
familiar
to
Englishspeaking
peoples
as
that
of
the
Iliad
Beowulf
is
our
first
great
epic
It
is
an
epitomized
history
of
the
life
of
the
Teutonic
races
It
brings
vividly
before
us
our
forefathers
of
preAlfredian
eras
in
their
love
of
war
of
sea
and
of
adventure

That

We

in

that
we

it

Boldly

He

I

To

on

further
than
I
could
More
swift
on

nor

I
from

Then
we

in

After

Five

As

He
did

gave
the

a

And
the

of

implicitly
trusted
Beowulf

selfconfident
His

and
the

He
prepares
for

His

then
His

from
his

to
his

committed
His

And
bade

The

uttered

Beowulf

of

to

with

I
hold
me
no

In

himself
Hence
I
seek
not

Of

In

The

lie
down
And
many
a

Sank
to

Seemed
it
unlikely
They
thought
it
very

that
they

That

But
God
raised
up

Too

The

takes
the

With
all
deference
to

I
must
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the

is
exhausting
his
resources
to
bring
out
clearly
the
supreme
event
on
which
the
whole
subsequent
action
turns
First

GRENDEL
AND

Grendel
comes
from
the

Neath
the

came
from

then
Grendel
going
Gods

The

In

grand
to

and
make

with
He
goes
towards
the
joyous
building
He
went
under
welkin
where
well
he
knew
of
The
winejoyous
building
brilliant
with
plating
Goldhall
of
earthmen
Not
the
earliest
occasion
This
was
not
his
first
visit
there
He
the
home
and
manor
of
Hrothgar
had
sought
Neer
found
he
in
lifedays
later
nor

Hardier

Then
came
to
the
building
the
warrior
marching
His
horrid
fingers
tear
the
door
open
Bereft
of
his

The
door
quickly
opened
On

fastened
when
his
fingers
had
touched
it
The
fell

had
flung

fury
so
bitter
Open
the
entrance
Early
thereafter
The
foeman
trod
the
shining
hallpavement
He
strides
furiously
into
the
hall
Strode
he
angrily
from
the
eyes
of
him
glimmered
A
lustre
unlovely
likest
to
fire
He
beheld
in
the
hall
the
heroes
in
numbers
A
circle
of
kinsmen
sleeping
together
He
exults
over
his
supposed
prey
A
throng
of
thanemen
then
his
thoughts
were
exultant
He
minded
to
sunder
from
each
of
the
thanemen
The
life
from
his
body

demon
Ere
morning
came
since
fate
had
allowed
him
Fate
has
decreed
that
he
shall
devour
no
more
heroes
Beowulf
suffers
from
suspense
The

of
plenty
Providence
willed
not
To
permit
him
any

under

To

Great
sorrow
endured
how
the

In

assaults
were
likely
to
bear
him
No

had
the
monster
of
deferring
the

Grendel
immediately
seizes
a
sleeping
warrior
and
devours
him
But
on
earliest
occasion
he
quickly
laid
hold
of
A
soldier
asleep
suddenly
tore
him
Bit
his
boneprison
the
blood
drank
in
currents
Swallowed
in
mouthfuls
he
soon
had
the
dead
mans
Feet
and

too
eaten
entirely
Nearer
he
strode
then
the
stouthearted
warrior

and

Snatched
as
he
slumbered

with

Forward
the
foeman
foined
with
his

Caught

quickly
the
cunning
deviser
On

he
rested
This
early
discovered
The

The

Fearful

Not

He
is

Would

His

The

recalls
his
boast
of
the
evening
and
determines
to
fulfil
it
Of

minded
his
speech
of

Stood
he
up
straight
and
stoutly
did
seize
him
His
fingers
crackled
the
giant

outward
The
earl
stepped
farther
The
famous
one
minded
To
flee
away
farther
if
he
found
an
occasion
And
off
and
away
avoiding
delay
To
fly
to
the
fenmoors
he
fully
was
ware
of
The
strength
of
his
grapple
in
the
grip
of
the
foeman
Twas
a
luckless
day
for
Grendel
Twas
an

The

reechoed
to

Dwellers

to

was
terror
Angry
they

Archwarders

Rattled

A
terror

on

Who
heard
from

the

The

For

Who
with

no

Had
wrought

To

The

The

was

At

When

REJOICING
OF
THE
DANES
At
early
dawn
warriors
from
far
and
near
come
together
to
hear
of
the
nights
adventures
In
the
mist
of
the
morning
many
a
warrior
Stood
round
the
gifthall
as
the
story
is
told
me
Folkprinces
fared
then
from
far
and
from
near
Through
longstretching
journeys
to
look
at
the
wonder
The
footprints
of
the
foeman
Few
of
the
warriors
Few
warriors
lamented
Grendels
destruction
Who
gazed
on
the
foottracks
of
the
inglorious
creature
His
parting
from
life
pained
very
deeply
How
weary
in
spirit
off
from
those
regions
In
combats
conquered
he
carried
his
traces
Fated
and
flying
to
the
flood
of
the
nickers
Grendels
blood
dyes
the
waters
There
in
bloody
billows
bubbled
the
currents
The
angry
eddy
was
everywhere
mingled
And
seething
with
gore
welling
with
swordblood
He
deathdoomed
had
hid
him
when
reaved
of
his
joyance
He
laid
down
his
life
in
the
lair
he
had
fled
to
His
heathenish
spirit
where
hell
did
receive
him
Thence
the
friends
from
of
old
backward
turned
them
And
many
a

from
merry
adventure
Striding
their
stallions
stout

Heroes

Beowulf

A

Four

Round

Braided

that
eight

The

Commanded

Just

passage

Prince

these

Which
thine

I
came
off

scaping
In

neath

the

I
Performed
and
the

had
been
finished
quite
nearly
Had
God
not

I
failed
in
the

Aught
to
accomplish
aided
by
Hrunting
Though
that
weapon
was
worthy
but
the
Wielder
of
earthfolk
God
was
fighting
with
me
Gave
me
willingly
to
see
on
the

a
Heavy

hanging
in

He
guided
most
often
the
lorn
and

That
I
swung
as

Who

Then

The

SORROW
AT
PARTING
Beowulfs
farewell
Beowulf
spake
Ecgtheows
offspring
We
men
of
the
water
wish
to
declare
now
Fared
from
farlands
were
firmly
determined
To
seek
King
Higelac
Here
have
we
fitly
Been
welcomed
and
feasted
as
heart
would
desire
it
Good
was
the
greeting
If
greater
affection
I
am
anywise
able
ever
on
earth
to
Gain
at
thy
hands
ruler
of
heroes
Than
yet
I
have
done
I
shall
quickly
be
ready
I
shall
be
ever
ready
to
aid
thee
For
combat
and
conflict
Oer
the
course
of
the
waters
Learn
I
that
neighbors
alarm
thee
with
terror
As
haters
did
whilom
I
hither
will
bring
thee
For
help
unto
heroes
henchmen
by
thousands
My
liegelord
will
encourage
me
in
aiding
thee
I
know
as
to
Higelac
the
lord
of
the
Geatmen
Though
young
in
years
he
yet
will
permit
me
By
words
and
by
works
ward
of
the
people
Fully
to
furnish
thee
forces
and
bear
thee
My
lance
to
relieve
thee
if
liegemen
shall
fail
thee
And
help
of
my
handstrength
if
Hrethric
be
treating
Bairn
of
the
king
at
the
court
of
the
Geatmen
He
thereat
may
find
him
friends
in
abundance
Faraway
countries
he
were
better
to
seek
for
Who
trusts
in
himself
Hrothgar
discoursed
then
Making
rejoinder
These
words
thou
hast
uttered
Allknowing
God
hath
given
thy
spirit
O
Beowulf
thou
art
wise
beyond
thy
years
Neer
heard
I
an
earlman
thus
early
in
life
More
clever
in
speaking
thourt
cautious
of
spirit
Mighty
of
muscle
in
mouthanswers
prudent
I
count
on
the
hope
that
happen
it
ever
That
missile
shall
rob
thee
of
Hrethels
descendant
Edgehorrid
battle
and
illness
or
weapon
Deprive
thee
of
prince
of
peoples
protector
Should
Higelac
die
the
Geats
could
find
no
better
successor
than
thou
wouldst
make
And
life
thou
yet
holdest
the
SeaGeats
will
never
Find
a
more
fitting
folklord
to
choose
them
Gemward
of
heroes
than
thou
mightest
prove
thee
If
the
kingdom
of
kinsmen
thou
carest
to
govern
Thy
moodspirit
likes
me
the
longer
the
better
Beowulf
dear
thou
hast
brought
it
to
pass
that
To
both
these
peoples
peace
shall
be
common
Thou
hast
healed
the
ancient
breach
between
our
races
To
Geatfolk
and
Danemen
the
strife
be
suspended
The
secret
assailings
they
suffered
in
yoredays
And
also
that
jewels
be
shared
while
I
govern
The
widestretching
kingdom
and
that
many
shall
visit
Others
oer
the
ocean
with
excellent
giftgems
The
ringadorned
bark
shall
bring
oer
the
currents
Presents
and
lovegifts
This
people
I
know
Towrd
foeman
and
friend
firmly
established
After
ancient
etiquette
everywise
blameless
Then
the
warden
of
earlmen
gave
him
still
farther
Parting
gifts
Kinsman
of
Healfdene
a
dozen
of
jewels
Bade
him
safely
seek
with
the
presents
His
wellbeloved
people
early
returning
Hrothgar
kisses
Beowulf
and
weeps
Then
the
nobleborn
king
kissed
the
distinguished
Dearlovd
liegeman
the
Daneprince
saluted
him
And
claspd
his
neck
tears
from
him
fell
From
the
grayheaded
man
he
two
things
expected
Agd
and
reverend
but
rather
the
second
That
bold
in
council
theyd
meet
thereafter
The
man
was
so
dear
that
he
failed
to
suppress
the
Emotions
that
moved
him
but
in
moodfetters
fastened
The
old
king
is
deeply
grieved
to
part
with
his
benefactor
The
longfamous
hero
longeth
in
secret
Deep
in
his
spirit
for
the
dearbeloved
man
Though
not
a
bloodkinsman
Beowulf
thenceward
Goldsplendid
warrior
walked
oer
the
meadows
Exulting
in
treasure
the
seagoing
vessel
Riding
at
anchor
awaited
its
owner
As
they
pressed
on
their
way
then
the
present
of
Hrothgar
Giving
liberally
is
the
true
proof
of
kingship
Was
frequently
referred
to
a
folkking
indeed
that
Everyway
blameless
till
age
did
debar
him
The
joys
of
his
might
which
hath
many
oft
injured
For
geworhte
the
crux
of
this
passage
B
proposes
gehte
rendering
I
know
this
people
with
firm
thought
every
way
blameless
towards
foe
and
friends
S
and
B
emend
so
as
to
negative
the
verb
meet
Why
should
Hrothgar
weep
if
he
expects
to
meet
Beowulf
again
both
these
scholars
ask
But
the
weeping
is
mentioned
before
the
expectations
the
tears
may
have
been
due
to
many
emotions
especially
gratitude
struggling
for
expression
XXVIII
THE
HOMEWARD
JOURNEYTHE
TWO
QUEENS
Then
the
band
of
very
valiant
retainers
Came
to
the
current
they
were
clad
all
in
armor
The
coastguard
again
In
linkwoven
burnies
The
landwarder
noticed
The
return
of
the
earlmen
as
he
erstwhile
had
seen
them
Nowise
with
insult
he
greeted
the
strangers
From
the
naze
of
the
cliff
but
rode
on
to
meet
them
Said
the
brightarmored
visitors

Welcome

The

Lay

With

Beowulf
gives

a

To

a
goldbound
brand
he
presented
That
he
was
afterwards
honored
on

more
highly
As
the

owner
Set
he
out
on
his
vessel
To
drive
on
the
deep
Danecountry
left
he
Along
by
the
mast
then
a
seagarment
fluttered
A

The

resounded
The

oer
the
waters
the
wavefloater
nowise
Kept
from
its
journey
the
seagoer
traveled
The
foamynecked
floated
forth
oer
the
currents
The
wellfashioned
vessel
oer
the
ways
of
the
ocean
The
Geats
see
their
own
land
again
Till
they
came
within
sight
of
the
cliffs
of
the
Geatmen
The
wellknown
headlands
The
wavegoer
hastened
Driven
by
breezes
stood
on
the
shore
The
portwarden
is
anxiously
looking
for
them
Prompt
at
the
ocean
the
portward
was
ready
Who
long
in
the
past
outlooked
in
the
distance
At
watersedge
waiting
welllovd

He
bound
to
the
bank
then
the
broadbosomed
vessel
Fast
in
its
fetters
lest
the
force
of
the
waters
Should
be
able
to
injure
the

Bade
he
up
then
take
the
treasure
of

Plategold
and
fretwork
not

was
it
thence
To
go
off
in

of
the
giver
of

Hrethels

Higelac
at

there

Himself
with

That

But

Of

BEOWULF
AND
HIGELAC
Then
the
brave
one
departed
his
band
along
with
him
Beowulf
and
his

seek
Higelac
Seeking
the

the
seamarches
treading
The
widestretching

The
worldcandle
glimmered
The
sun
from
the
southward
they
proceeded
then
onward
Early
arriving
where
they
heard
that
the
trooplord
Ongentheows
slayer
excellent
youthful
Folkprince
and
warrior
was
distributing
jewels
Close
in
his
castle
The
coming
of
Beowulf
Was
announced
in
a
message
quickly
to
Higelac
That
the
folktroops
defender
forth
to
the
palace
The
lindencompanion
alive
was
advancing
Secure
from
the
combat
courtward
agoing
The
building
was
early
inward
made
ready
For
the
footgoing
guests
as
the
good
one
had
ordered
Beowulf
sits
by
his
liegelord
He
sat
by
the
man
then
who
had
lived
through
the
struggle
Kinsman
by
kinsman
when
the
king
of
the
people
Had
in
lordly
language
saluted
the
dear
one
Queen
Hygd
receives
the
heroes
In
words
that
were
formal
The
daughter
of
Hreth
Coursed
through
the

She
loved
the

the

To
the

Higelac

then
Higelac
is
greatly
interested
in
Beowulfs
adventures
Pleasantly
plying
his
companion
with
questions
In
the
hightowering
palace
A
curious
interest
Tormented
his
spirit
what

in
The

Beowulf

Give
an
account
of
thy

Beowulf

How
throve

suddenly
Far
oer

to

A

at
Heorot
Hast
bettered
for
Hrothgar
The
famous
folkleader

sorrows
Any
at

In

My
suspense
has
been
great
I
mused
upon
torture
distrusted
the
journey
Of
the
belovd
liegeman
I
long
time
did
pray
thee
By
no
means
to
seek
out
the
murderous
spirit
To
suffer
the
SouthDanes
themselves
to
decide
on
Grappling
with
Grendel
To
God
I
am
thankful
To
be
suffered
to
see
thee

Beowulf

From

It

And

When

Art

The

In

The

And

When

So
he

With

To

The

Not

The

mindful

Wish

But
sturdy
of

he
strove
to
outdo

Handready

A

Spacious

in

fastened
Which
was
fashioned
entirely
by
touch
of
the

From

He

Though

Tis

to

For

I
reflected
honor
upon

Twas
there
my

that
I
proudly
distinguished
Thy

with

He
left
and
retreated
He
lived
his
life
a
little
while
longer
Yet
his
righthand

his
footstep
in
Heorot
And
sadmooded
thence
to

fell
he
Mournful
in

For

mightrush
of

King
Hrothgar
lavished
gifts
upon
me
The
friend
of
the
Scyldings
with
gold
that
was
plated
With
ornaments
many
much
requited
me
When
daylight
had
dawned
and
down
to
the
banquet
We
had
sat
us
together
There
was
chanting
and

The

asked
many
questions
And
of
oldtimes
related

touched
by

Now
he
uttered
measures
mourning
and
truthful
Then
the
largehearted

a

of
wonder
Truthfully
told
us
Now
troubled
with
years
The
old
king
is
sad
over
the
loss
of
his
youthful
vigor
The
agehoary
warrior
afterward
began
to
Mourn
for
the
might
that
marked
him
in
youthdays
His
breast
within
boiled
when
burdened
with
winters
Much
he
remembered
From
morning
till
night
then
We
joyed
us
therein
as

Till
the

came
unto

Then
early
thereafter
the

of
Grendel
Grendels

Was
ready
for

wretched
she
journeyed
Her

had

The
horrible
woman
avengd
her

And
with

mainstrength
murdered
a

There
the

Were

Nor

She

She

The

Dashed

Then
the

Found
the

He

to

Encompassed

Widely

Tis

The

in

where

he
is

The
heathenish
treasure

nowise

The

meets
his

So
threehundred
winters
the

Held
upon

that
excellent

Till
the

earlman
angered
him
bitterly
The
beatplated
beaker
he
bare
to
his
chieftain
And
fullest
remission
for
all
his
remissness
Begged
of
his
liegelord
Then
the
hoard
was
discovered
The
treasure
was
taken
his

was
granted
The
hero
plunders
the

den
The
lornmooded
liegeman
His
lord
regarded
The
oldwork
of

the
earliest
occasion
When
the
dragon
awoke
the
strife
was
renewed
there
He
snuffed
long
the
stone
then
stouthearted
found
he
The
footprint
of
foeman
too
far
had
he
gone
With
cunning
craftiness
close
to
the
head
of
The
firespewing
dragon
So
undoomed
he
may
scape
from
Anguish
and
exile
with

The

The

eagerly
Searched
oer
the
ground
then
would
meet
with
the
person
That
caused
him
sorrow
while
in
slumber
reclining
Gleaming
and
wild
he
oft
went
round
the
cavern
All
of
it
outward
not
any
of
earthmen
Was
seen
in
that
desert
Yet
he
joyed
in
the
battle
Rejoiced
in
the
conflict
oft
he
turned
to
the
barrow
Sought
for
the
gemcup
this
he
soon
perceived
then
The
dragon
perceives
that
some
one
has
disturbed
his
treasure
That
some
man
or
other
had
discovered
the
gold
The
famous
folktreasure
Not
fain
did
the
hoardward
Wait
until
evening
then
the
ward
of
the
barrow
Was
angry
in
spirit
the
loathd
one
wished
to
Pay
for
the
dearvalued
drinkcup
with
fire
Then
the
day
was
done
as
the
dragon
would
have
it
He
no

would
wait
on
the

but
departed
The

infuriated
Fireimpelled
flaming
Fearful

To

The

Bare

As

The

distinct
translations
of

have
arisen
One
takes

as

inserting

renders
The

every

who

The
other
takes
oferhgian
as
meaning
to

arrogant
and
giving

a
moralizing
tone
renders
substantially
as

of

Cf

The
passage

is
very
much
disputed
The

by

regarded

by
others
as
that
of
the
ancient
possessor

XXXIX
THE
DEAD
FOESWIGLAFS
BITTER
TAUNTS
Wiglaf
is
sorely
grieved
to
see
his
lord
look
so
unwarlike
It
had
wofully
chanced
then
the
youthful
retainer
To
behold
on
earth
the
most
ardentbelovd
At
his
lifedays
limit
lying
there
helpless
The
slayer
too
lay
there
of
life
all
bereavd
Horrible
earthdrake
harassed
with
sorrow
The
dragon
has
plundered
his
last
hoard
The
roundtwisted
monster
was
permitted
no
longer
To
govern
the
ringhoards
but
edges
of

Mightily
seized
him
battlesharp
sturdy
Leavings
of
hammers
that
still
from
his
wounds
The
flierfromfarland
fell
to
the
earth
Hard
by
his
hoardhouse
hopped
he
at
midnight
Not
eer
through
the
air
nor
exulting
in
jewels
Suffered
them
to
see
him
but
he
sank
then
to
earthward
Through
the
herochiefs
handwork
I
heard
sure
it
throve
then
Few
warriors
dared
to
face
the
monster
But
few
in
the
land
of
liegemen
of
valor
Though
of
every
achievement
bold
he
had
proved
him
To
run
gainst
the
breath
of
the
venomous
scather
Or
the
hall
of
the
treasure
to
trouble
with
handblows
If
he
watching
had
found
the
ward
of
the
hoardhall
On
the
barrow
abiding
Beowulfs
part
of
The
treasure
of
jewels
was
paid
for
with
death
Each
of
the
twain
had
attained
to
the
end
of
Life
so
unlasting
Not
long
was
the
time
till
The
cowardly
thanes
come
out
of
the
thicket
The
tardyatbattle
returned
from
the
thicket
The
timid
trucebreakers
ten
all
together
Who
durst
not
before
play
with
the
lances
In
the
prince
of
the
peoples
pressing
emergency
They
are
ashamed
of
their
desertion
But
blushing
with
shame
with
shields
they
betook
them
With
arms
and
armor
where
the
old
one
was
lying
They
gazed
upon
Wiglaf
He
was
sitting
exhausted
Footgoing
fighter
not
far
from
the
shoulders
Of
the
lord
of
the
people
would
rouse
him
with
water
No
whit
did
it
help
him
though
he
hoped
for
it
keenly
He
was
able
on
earth
not
at
all
in
the
leader
Life
to
retain
and
nowise
to
alter
The
will
of
the
Wielder
the
WorldRulers
power
Would
govern
the
actions
of
each

of

Wiglaf
is
ready
to
excoriate
them
As
yet
He
is
doing
From
the
young
one
forthwith
then
Could
grimworded
greeting
be
got
for
him
quickly
Whose
courage
had
failed
him
Wiglaf
discoursed
then
Weohstan
his

He

When

Fifty

forth
in

To

To

With

eaten

A
thousand
of

there
they

Higelces
meaning

suggests

Higelces

HSo
reading
as
translated
in

text
means
that
the
banner
of
the
enemy
was
captured
and
brought
to

as
a
trophy
The
rendering
given
in
this
translation
represents
the
king
as
being
generous
beyond
the
possibility
of
reproach
but
some
authorities
construe
him
as
plu
and
understand
the
passage
to
mean
that
no
one
reproached
the
two
brothers
with
having
received
more
reward
than
they
were
entitled
to
The
name
Scyldingas
here
has
caused
much
discussion
and
given
rise
to
several
theories
the
most
important
of
which
are
as
follows
After
the
downfall
of
Hrothgars
family
Beowulf
was
king
of
the
Danes
or
Scyldings
For
Scyldingas
read
Scylfingasthat
is
after
killing
Eadgils
the
Scylfing
prince
Beowulf
conquered
his
land
and
held
it
in
subjection
M
considers
a
thoughtless
repetition
of
Cf
HSo
B
takes
nihtes
and
hwlum
as
separate
adverbial
cases
and
renders
Joy
in
the
air
had
he
of
yore
by
night
etc
He
thinks
that
the
idea
of
vanished
time
ought
to
be
expressed
The
parenthesis
is
by
some
emended
so
as
to
read
He
ie
God
is
the
hope
of
men
he
is
the
hope
of
heroes
Grs
reading
has
no
parenthesis
but
says
could
touch
unless
God
himself
true
king
of
victories
gave
to
whom
he
would
to
open
the
treasure
the
secret
place
of
enchanters
etc
The
last
is
rejected
on
many
grounds

CARRIED
OFF
Then
twas

that
the

prospered
him
little
Who
wrongly

had
the

hidden
Down
neath

The

Some

of

thereafter
Was

Tis
a

where
When

of
Lifedays
allotted
then
no

the
man
may
Remain
with

where

So
to
Beowulf
happened
when
the
ward
of
the
barrow
Assaults
he
sought
for
himself
had
no
knowledge
How
his
leaving
this
life
was
likely
to

So
to
doomsday
famous
folkleaders
down
did
Call
it
with

complished
it

That
that

be
ever
of

convicted
Confined
in
foulplaces
fastened
in

Punished
with
plagues
who
this

He
cared
not
for

rather
the

Favor
preferred
he
first
to

very
grimly

the
fate
that
The
prince
of
the

pricked
to

thither
I
was
therein
and
all
of
it
looked
at
The

since

was

Not
kindly
at

He
tells

Hastily

And
held

To

And

Much

mournfully
commanded

Ye

As

While

Let

hasten
Again
to

The

I
will

you
That

Let

Wellbeloved

Then
the

bade

be

that
they
hither

Now
the
wisemooded
son
of
Wihstan
did
summon
The
best
of
the
braves
from
the
band
of
the
ruler
He
takes
seven
thanes
and
enters
the
den
Seven
together
neath

he
Went
with
the

one
of
the
heroes
Who
fared
at
the
front
a
fireblazing
torchlight
Bare
in
his

No
lot
then
decided
Who
that
hoard
should
havoc
when
heroearls
saw
it
Lying
in
the
cavern
uncaredfor
entirely
Rusting
to
ruin
they
rued
then
but
little
That
they
hastily
hence
hauled
out
the

They
push

For

the
passage
would
stand
as
above
except
the
change
of

to

The
reference
however
would
be
to
the
thief
not
to
the

The
passage

be
a
question
asking
whether
it
was
strange
that
a
man
should
die
when
his
appointed
time
had
comeB
sees
a
corruption
and
makes
emendations
introducing
the
idea
that
a
brave
man
should
not
die
from
sickness
or
from
old
age
but
should
find
death
in
the
performance
of
some
deed
of

sees
an
indirect
question
introduced
by
hwr
and
dependent
upon

A
secret
is
it
when
the
hero
is
to
die
etcWhy
may
the
two
clauses
not
be
parallel
and
the
whole
passage
an
Old
English
cry
of
How
wonderful

is
the
best
yet

if
wundor
means

For

stride
This
would
require
ravage

He
cared
sight
of

emends
so
as
to
read
as
follows
He
Beowulf
had
not
before
seen
the
favor
of
the
avaricious
possessor
B
renders
That
which
drew
the
king
thither
ie
the
treasure
was
granted
us
but
in
such
a
way
that
it
overcomes
us
Folcgende
B
takes
as
dat
sing
with

and
refers
it
to
Beowulf
that
is
Should

place
where

C
proposes
to
take

L

This
gives
a
parallel
to

The

would
be
discarded
and
the
passage
read
Now

consume

THE

The

Behung

Then

The

Till

Hot

The

In

As

it
They

All

Mightily

ADDENDA
Several

Of
these
a
good
part
were

by
Harrison

The
rest
will
I

be
